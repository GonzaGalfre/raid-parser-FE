Your raid team demonstrates strong progression with a 12% overall improvement 
across the analysis period. Notable achievements include exceptional DPS growth 
and consistent healing performance. However, attendance concerns with several 
key players may impact future progression.

Recommendations: Address roster stability issues and continue current 
improvement strategies while focusing on consistent attendance.

KEY INSIGHTS:
• Performance Improvement: Shadowmage (Fire Mage) improved 23% (67% → 90%)
• Performance Improvement: Healbot (Holy Priest) improved 18% (72% → 90%)  
• Low Attendance: Absentplayer (Protection Warrior) only 4/8 raids (50%)
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Files Updated:
- `src/services/aiReportService.ts` - Core AI service with new providers
- `src/components/AIReportDialog.tsx` - Updated UI for new providers

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues:

**"Model is loading" Error (Hugging Face)**
- This is normal for free tier - models need to "warm up"
- Wait 30-60 seconds and try again
- Switch to Gemini as alternative

**"Invalid API Key" Error**
- Double-check you copied the full key
- Ensure no extra spaces
- For Hugging Face: Key should start with `hf_`
- For Gemini: Key should start with `AIza`

**"Need at least 2 reports" Error**
- Import more raid reports first
- Ensure timeline analysis is available
- Check that reports have valid dates

### Rate Limits:
- **Hugging Face**: ~1000 requests/month (very generous)
- **Gemini**: 15 requests/minute, 1500/day (free tier)
