# Enhanced Timeline Analysis Feature

## Overview

The **Enhanced Timeline Analysis Feature** provides comprehensive raid progression tracking across multiple reports. Unlike simple two-report comparisons, this advanced system automatically analyzes all imported reports chronologically to show:

- **Automatic Chronological Ordering**: Reports are automatically sorted by date
- **Raid-Level Progression**: Overall team performance trends over time
- **Individual Player Journeys**: Detailed progression tracking for each player
- **Smart Trend Detection**: Automatic classification of improvement patterns

## How to Use

### 1. Import Multiple Reports
- Add **2 or more** report codes in the Settings panel
- Each report is automatically fetched and timestamped
- No manual date entry required - uses actual raid dates from WarcraftLogs

### 2. Access Timeline Analysis
- Once you have 2+ reports loaded, a **"Timeline Analysis"** button appears
- Click to automatically generate chronological progression analysis
- No need to manually select which reports to compare

### 3. View Comprehensive Results
- **Raid Overview Dashboard**: Key metrics and overall trends
- **Timeline Visualization**: Chronological progression of raid performance  
- **Individual Player Analysis**: Detailed progression for each player
- **Smart Filtering**: Focus on specific trends or significant changes
